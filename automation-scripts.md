## üìñ Documentation & Usage

This file documents all automation scripts, agent actions, and automation requests for the 
H3X-fLups unified workspace. Use it to:

- Track all current and obsolete automation scripts
- Log agent actions and automation completions
- Propose and document new automations
- Reference usage examples for each script

For integration with the Merger Task Manager, see the "Agent Actions" section below.

## ‚ûï Adding New Automations

(Add new automation requests below as they are created.)

## ü§ñ Agent Actions (All)

Agents should log automation completions, errors, and status updates here for both current and obsolete automations. Use timestamps and reference the related task in `Merger Task Manager.md`.

**Agent Log Template:**
- [ ] `<script or action>` (`<status>`) @ `<timestamp>`
  - `<log message>`
  - Related task: `<task name>`

## üîÑ TypeScript Conversion Plan

The following Node.js automation scripts are candidates for conversion to TypeScript for improved maintainability and type safety:

- [ ] `merge-modular-to-allinone.js` ‚Üí `merge-modular-to-allinone.ts`
- [ ] `cicd-automation.js` ‚Üí `cicd-automation.ts`
- [ ] `health-check.js` ‚Üí `health-check.ts`
- [ ] `merger-ui-server.js` ‚Üí `merger-ui-server.ts`

Scripts already in TypeScript:
- [x] `h3x-modular-clean.ts`
- [x] `h3x-modular-backup.ts`

> Begin conversion by creating a TypeScript version of each script, ensuring feature parity and updating documentation/usage examples accordingly.
