# SIR System No-OpenAI Version - Completion Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Core Implementation
- Created `agent-no-openai.js` - Fully functional agent without OpenAI dependency
- Updated `index.js` to use the no-OpenAI agent implementation
- Implemented the `SIRSystemState` class for comprehensive state management
- Integrated with `hexperimentFramework.js` for standards compliance

### Tool Implementation
- Updated `environmentSimulationTool.js` to use real-life standards
- Created `monitoringTool.js` for environmental monitoring
- Created `humanSupervisionTool.js` for human-supervised confirmation
- Retained `dateTimeTool.js` for time-based functions
- Ensured all tools work without OpenAI dependency

### Configuration and Setup
- Created `.env.no-openai` environment configuration
- Updated `package.json` with no-openai specific scripts and dependencies
- Created `deploy-no-openai.js` deployment script
- Ensured manifest.json is valid with proper UUIDs

### Documentation
- Created `README-NO-OPENAI.md` with detailed usage instructions
- Updated `SIR-NO-OPENAI-COMPLETE.md` with implementation details
- Added no-OpenAI scripts to package.json for easy usage
