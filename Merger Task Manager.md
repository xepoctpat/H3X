## üîÑ Automated Updates

This file is designed for automated updates by agents and scripts. To keep task statuses, logs, and progress current:

- Agents/scripts should programmatically:
  - Mark tasks as complete/in progress by updating checklist items.
  - Append status updates and timestamps to the relevant sections.
  - Log any issues or manual interventions required.
- All automation logic and update scripts should be managed and documented in [`automation-scripts.md`](automation-scripts.md).
- Manual edits should be avoided when automation is available.

For implementation details and update script examples, see the "Agent Actions" and script documentation in [`automation-scripts.md`](automation-scripts.md).
