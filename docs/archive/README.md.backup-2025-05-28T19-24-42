# Hexperiment Labs SIR Control Interface - Microsoft 365 Agents Implementation

This SIR (Super Intelligent Regulator) Control Interface demonstrates advanced AI system management using the [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/Agents). The SIR agent provides environmental analysis, simulation control, and AI assistant generation capabilities.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Environmental Analysis** - Real-time analysis of environmental conditions and AI system status
- **Simulation Control** - Advanced simulation management and experimental control systems
- **AI Assistant Generation** - Dynamic creation and deployment of specialized AI assistants
- **Monitoring System** - Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters with real-life standards
- **Human Supervision** - Request and process human-supervised confirmation for critical operations
- **Adaptive Cards** - Beautiful, interactive responses with SIR-style formatting
- **Date/Time Tools** - Intelligent temporal analysis for system operations
- **Multiple Deployment Options** - Test locally, in playground, or deploy to Teams/Azure
- **No External Dependencies** - Can operate without OpenAI dependency (Microsoft SDK only version)

## ðŸ“‹ Available Versions

This SIR Control Interface has two implementation options:

### 1. Standard Version (with OpenAI)
- Uses LangChain integration with OpenAI GPT models
- Requires an OpenAI API key
- Provides advanced reasoning capabilities

### 2. No-OpenAI Version
- Uses only Microsoft SDK Agents (no external AI dependencies)
- No API key required
- Implements real-life environment creation standards
- Includes monitoring and human-supervised confirmation scenarios
- Based on Hexperiment Labs framework from provided PDFs

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

This SIR Control Interface can run in several environments:

1. **Microsoft 365 Agents Playground** - Browser-based testing (no Teams required)
2. **Microsoft Teams** - Full Teams integration with channels and chats
3. **Azure Bot Service** - Deploy as a standalone SIR service
4. **Local Development** - Direct Express.js server for SIR testing

Note: The SIR system works best with newer OpenAI models like gpt-4o-mini that support reliable JSON output for complex environmental analysis.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22.
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches the SIR Control Interface in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send SIR commands like "Analyze environmental conditions" or "What is the status of the SIR system?" to interact with the interface.

**Congratulations**! You are running the SIR Control Interface that can now provide environmental analysis and simulation control through Microsoft 365 Agents Playground.
