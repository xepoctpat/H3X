# Azure Dependency Check Removal - Summary

**Date**: June 1, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Changes Made

- Removed Azure dependency verification from `setup-check.js`
- Replaced Azure dependency checks with essential script verification
- Updated summary output to remove Azure references
- Updated CONTINUE-TO-ITERATE-READY.md to note the Azure-free status

## Why This Change?

The H3X-fLups system has matured beyond the need for Azure dependency checks. The system is now fully operational in
standalone mode with all necessary local functionality and the original transition away from Azure dependencies has been
successfully completed.

## Verification

The `setup-check.js` script has been tested and confirmed to be working correctly without any Azure-related checks
while still properly verifying the core system components and structure.

## Completion Date

Completed: June 1, 2025
