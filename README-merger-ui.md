# fLups Merger Control UI

This UI and server allow you to control and visualize the state/configuration of the fLups merger (v-merger.js) and its experimental features in real time.

## Files
- `merger-ui.html`: Web UI for toggling experimental features and viewing the amendment log/state.
- `merger-ui-server.js`: Node.js Express backend to serve the UI, config, and state endpoints.
- `flup-merger-config.json`: Config file for merger features (read/written by UI and v-merger.js).
- `flup-n-amendments.log`: Log file of amendments (virtual proof steps), generated by v-merger.js.

## Usage
1. Run the server:
   ```
   node merger-ui-server.js
   ```
2. Open [http://localhost:3007/merger-ui.html](http://localhost:3007/merger-ui.html) in your browser.
3. Use the checkboxes to toggle features and view the current amendment log/state.

## Notes
- The UI expects the backend to be running in the same directory as the config and log files.
- Changes made in the UI are written to `flup-merger-config.json` and will be picked up by `v-merger.js` on next run.
- The state log is read-only and reflects the current tracked amendments.

For further integration, you may want to add live reload or WebSocket support for real-time updates.
