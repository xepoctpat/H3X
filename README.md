# Weather Agent - Microsoft 365 Agents Template

This weather agent template demonstrates how to build intelligent conversational AI using the [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/Agents) with LangChain integration. The agent provides weather forecasts with beautiful adaptive card responses and can be deployed in multiple environments.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Smart Weather Forecasting** - Ask about weather for any date and location
- **LangChain Integration** - Advanced AI reasoning with OpenAI GPT models
- **Adaptive Cards** - Beautiful, interactive responses in Teams-style format
- **Date/Time Tools** - Intelligent date parsing and calculations
- **Multiple Deployment Options** - Test locally, in playground, or deploy to Teams/Azure
- **Memory Management** - Conversation context retention across interactions

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

This agent can run in several environments:

1. **Microsoft 365 Agents Playground** - Browser-based testing (no Teams required)
2. **Microsoft Teams** - Full Teams integration with channels and chats
3. **Azure Bot Service** - Deploy as a standalone bot service
4. **Local Development** - Direct Express.js server for testing

Note: This template works best with newer OpenAI models like gpt-4o-mini that support reliable JSON output.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22.
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your agent in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the agent.

**Congratulations**! You are running an agent that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground.
