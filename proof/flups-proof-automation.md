# fLups Proof Automation Guide

This document describes how to automate the generation and update of formal logic, axioms, and proof sketches for the fLups system.

## Automation Steps

1. **Edit Source Files**
   - Update axioms, definitions, or theorems in `flups-formal-proof.md` as needed.
   - Add new proof sketches or formal logic as new sections.

2. **Run Automation Script**
   - Use a script (e.g., `generate-flups-proof.js` or a Makefile) to:
     - Concatenate or update proof sections.
     - Validate LaTeX/math formatting.
     - Optionally, convert to PDF or HTML for sharing.

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Integrate proof updates into your CI/CD pipeline.
   - On commit to the `proof/` folder, trigger validation and re-generation.

## Example Automation Script (Node.js)

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const proofPath = path.join(__dirname, 'flups-formal-proof.md');
const outputPath = path.join(__dirname, 'flups-formal-proof-latest.md');

// Simple copy/update automation
ds = fs.readFileSync(proofPath, 'utf-8');
fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, ds);
console.log('Proof updated:', outputPath);
```

## Notes
- Keep each proof part modular for easy automation.
- Use markdown with LaTeX for math, or export to PDF for publication.
- For advanced automation, use Pandoc or LaTeX toolchains.
