// --- fLups Time/Action Note ---
// If no action is detected (no state change), the system's time is fundamentally undefined:
// It may appear 'frozen' or 'infinite', but this cannot be determined internally.
// Time in fLups is not an absolute property; it only emerges through relation or comparison
// with another process, observer, or system. Without such a relation, the temporal state
// of the system is indeterminate and has no operational meaning.
