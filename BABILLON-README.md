# Babillon Branch - Modular Agentic Interface

## Overview

The **Babillon** branch is dedicated to building a modular, agentic interface system inspired by the Library of Babel concept. This branch focuses on creating a highly modular architecture where agents can navigate and manipulate structured data through a central SIR (System/Interface/Relay) host.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SIR Host (`js/sirHost.js`)**
   - Central controller for all UI, agent, and data actions
   - Event-driven architecture with pub/sub system
   - API for navigation, loop manipulation, and state queries
   - Comprehensive logging for traceability

2. **Hexagonal Grid Navigation (`js/hex-grid.js`)**
   - 2D hexagonal grid using SVG rendering
   - Axial coordinate system for navigation
   - Click-to-navigate interface
   - Integrates with SIR host for state management

3. **Traid Editor (`js/traid-editor.js`)**
   - Triangular editor for loop manipulation
   - Interactive circle connection points
   - Support for coupled and open loops
   - Real-time visual feedback

4. **Agentic Interface (`js/agentic-ui.js`)**
   - Automated control and demonstration system
   - Agent API for programmatic control
   - Real-time logging and status updates
   - Demo sequences for testing

5. **Proof Editor (`proof-editor.html`)**
   - Markdown editor with live preview
   - Mermaid.js integration for diagrams
   - File management for proof documents

## Agentic Capabilities

### Agent API

```javascript
// Navigate to a specific cell
window.agent.executeCommand({
  type: 'navigate',
  q: 1, r: 0
});

// Create a coupled loop
window.agent.executeCommand({
  type: 'createLoop',
  a: 0, b: 1, coupled: true
});

// Get current system state
const state = window.agent.getState();
```

### Demo Mode

- Automated demonstration sequences
- Real-time action logging
- Visual feedback for all operations

## Key Features

1. **Modularity**: All components communicate through SIR host
2. **Agentic Control**: Programmatic interface for automated actions
3. **Event-Driven**: Reactive UI updates based on SIR events
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new components and capabilities
5. **Library of Babel Inspired**: Navigation through combinatorial spaces

## Docker Integration

The babillon branch includes Docker support for:

- Development environment setup
- Modular service architecture
- Scalable deployment options

## Future Roadmap

1. **3D/4D Visualization**: Extend to Three.js for 3D navigation
2. **Backend Integration**: RESTful API for data persistence
3. **Advanced Agents**: AI-driven exploration and pattern recognition
4. **Collaborative Features**: Multi-user simultaneous editing
5. **Library of Babel Integration**: Direct content scraping and visualization

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.modular.html` in a browser
2. Interact with the hex grid and traid editor
3. Use the "Run Agent Demo" button to see automated control
4. Monitor the status log for all actions and events

## Development Notes

- All components are designed to be independently testable
- SIR host provides complete action traceability
- Event system enables loose coupling between components
- Agent API allows for sophisticated automation scenarios
