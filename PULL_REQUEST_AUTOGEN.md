# Pull Request: Hexperiment Labs SIR Control Interface - Codebase Cleanup & Protocol Simulation

## 🚀 Overview

This pull request introduces a codebase cleanup and a major checkpoint for the Hexperiment Labs SIR Control Interface. It adds protocol-driven simulation logic, scenario/action groups, and world controls for future UI/backend integration.

## 📋 What's New

### 🔧 Core Features
- **Protocol-driven Simulation**: Adds a hidden, standards-compliant simulation function for protocol/scenario-based environment simulation (future integration).
- **Scenario/Action Groups**: Exports sensible groups of simulation types, scenario types, and world control actions for UI/backend use.
- **World Controls**: Prepares the codebase for advanced world and simulation control in the UI and backend.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removes obsolete code, organizes exports, and ensures all new features are checkpointed.
- **Logical Commit**: All changes are checkpointed in a single, descriptive commit for easy review and rollback.

## 📁 File Structure (Key Changes)
- `src/tools/environmentSimulationTool.js`: Main focus of this PR. See new exports and protocol-driven simulation logic.

## ✅ Testing Verification
- All changes are backward-compatible and do not affect current UI or API.
- Protocol-driven simulation is hidden/unused for now, but ready for future integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Pull this branch.
2. Run the app as usual (e.g., `npm start` or via VS Code tasks).
3. All new features are available for future UI/backend wiring.

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Codebase cleaned and checkpointed
- ✅ Protocol-driven simulation logic added
- ✅ Scenario/action/world control groups exported
- ✅ Ready for next phase of UI/backend integration
